# Modern Python Docs

## What is it?

This automatically redirects all Python 2 docs to the latest Python 3.

## Why?

Because Python 2.7 is REALLY old, [a large number of projects have committed to stop supporting it](https://python3statement.org/), and DuckDuckGo always recommends Python 2 docs before Python 3 for some reason.

Also I couldn't find an extension that did this. I might refactor this into an addon that allows for configurable user redirects later, but for now, this'll do the job.
